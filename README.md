### A video demonstrating the searching procedure for various SMs

It records the process of searching for risky car-following scenarios using six surrogate models and random testing method. We adopt an Operational Design Domain with six high-risk scenarios. It also demonstrates the comparison of the searching efficiency and accuracy of different surrogate models
 
In order to save the video time, each searching process is accelerated by the same degree. The CPU runtime of each surrogate model is marked when all risky scenarios are found or the maximum number of tested scenarios is reached.
